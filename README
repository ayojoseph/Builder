Welcome to builder 1.0!

To run this project you will ned xcode, CocoaPods, Npm, and React-native installed.

You will have to run 'npm install' to get all the node packages.

Then 'cd ios' to get into the ios folder and 'pod install' to install the necessary pods.

Then change back into the main directory (cd ..) and run 'npx react-native run-ios'.

Should take around 5-10 minutes to build everything.
